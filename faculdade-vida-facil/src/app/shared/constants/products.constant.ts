    description: `<strong>Now a #1 New York Times Bestseller.</strong> <br />
    <strong>Human beings have never had it better than we have it now in the West.
    So why are we on the verge of throwing it all away?</strong> <br />
    In 2016, New York Times bestselling author Ben Shapiro spoke at the University of California–Berkeley.
    Hundreds of police officers were required to protect his speech.
    What was so frightening about Shapiro? He came to argue that Western civilization is in
    the midst of a crisis of purpose and ideas; that we have let grievances replace our sense
    of community and political expediency limit our individual rights; `

    title: `The Left Behind: Decline and Rage in Rural America`,
    subtitle: `How a fraying social fabric is fueling the outrage of rural Americans`,
    description: `What is fueling rural America's outrage toward the federal government?
      Why did rural Americans vote overwhelmingly for Donald Trump? And, beyond economic
      and demographic decline, is there a more nuanced explanation for the growing rural-urban divide?
      Drawing on more than a decade of research and hundreds of interviews, Robert Wuthnow brings us into
      America's small towns, farms, and rural communities to paint a rich portrait of
      the moral order--the interactions, loyalties, obligations, and identities―underpinning
      this critical segment of the nation. Wuthnow demonstrates that to truly understand rural
      Americans' anger, their culture must be explored more fully.`

    title: `Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief`,
    subtitle: `Why have people from different cultures and eras formulated myths and stories with similar structures?`,
    description: `Why have people from different cultures and eras formulated myths
      and stories with similar structures? What does this similarity tell us about
      the mind, morality, and structure of the world itself? Jordan Peterson offers
      a provocative new hypothesis that explores the connection between what modern
      neuropsychology tells us about the brain and what rituals, myths, and religious
      stories have long narrated. A cutting-edge work that brings together neuropsychology,
      cognitive science, and Freudian and Jungian approaches to mythology and narrative,
      Maps of Meaning presents a rich theory that makes the wisdom and meaning of myth
      accessible to the critical modern mind.`
